# Team 702's History
Our laptops are cluttered with old project files varying in complexity, completeness, and usefulness. While not deserving individual repositories on their own, we seek to store records of past team members' work to track how our codebases have changed over time.

Our solution: **make a mono-repo!**

Sifting through these folders, you might find a rabbit-hole of a side project, the ocassional competition code from a previous year, or just plain junk: there's no guarantee ðŸ˜…

# Q/A
If you have any questions about a specific folder...
* submit an issue and include the folder's name in the title
* describe what you want to figure out/clarify

... and we will get back to you as soon as we can. Keep in mind: some projects precede our time on the team.

# That's it! Enjoy this slice of Bagel Byte history
